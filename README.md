# Preconditions

* php >= 5.3
* phpunit >= 3.6 (if you want to run the tests)
* [composer](http://getcomposer.org/)


# Installation

If you do not yet have composer, install it like this

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin

To install jackalope itselves, run the following in the parent directory of where you want jackalope

    git clone git://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-mongodb.git
    cd jackalope-mongodb
    php /usr/local/bin/composer.phar install --dev

Note that the --dev parameter is only needed if you want to be
able to run the test suite. If you already installed jackalope without the test
suite, you need to remove composer.lock before running composer again with the
--dev parameter.


## phpunit Tests

If you want to run the tests , please see the [README file in the tests folder](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-mongodb/blob/master/tests/README.md)
and check if you told composer to install the suggested dependencies (see Installation)


# Bootstrapping

Jackalope relies on autoloading. Namespaces and folders are compliant with
PSR-0. You should use the autoload file generated by composer:
``vendor/.composer/autoload.php``

If you want to integrate jackalope into other PSR-0 compliant code and use your
own classloader, find the mapping in ``vendor/.composer/autoload_namespaces.php``

Before you can use jackalope with a database, you need to set up the database.
